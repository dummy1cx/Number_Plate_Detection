# Read me to understand the folders structure

#
This folder contains all the failed experiments conducted for achieveing higher accuracy.
#
For achieving higher accuracy, multiple experiments was conducted as the objective was to beat the Ultralytics YOLOv8 model.
#
All the experiments with different backbones/transformers model/ attention mechanisms/ Detection Head were conducted.
#
Most of the failed experiments were not pushed to the repo as non maintainace of code versioning as now it is difficult to identify and separte from overall experiments. Model which are retrived only pushed to the failed experiment repo
#
This folder contains all the failed experiemnts for future referecnes
